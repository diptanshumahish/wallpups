# Wallpups

Wallpups is a multi-platform open source app being developed using Flutter.

This App mainly focuses on an innovative and beautiful User Interface, and is basically a 
wallpaper app, which for the time collects data using the random image generator provided
by Unsplash.

Later on I have plans to merge this with a proper backend and make it a 100% working app
and maybe launch it on platforms.
